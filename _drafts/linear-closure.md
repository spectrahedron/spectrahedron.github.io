title:  "Linear closure of convex sets in real vector spaces"
author: "Vera Roshchina"

The post is prompted by a recent exchange with referees on a paper I am working on jointly with my coauthor Dr Reinier Diaz Millan. A fascinating thing is that the referee pointed us to a bunch of papers that were published in the 50s, and not so much forgotten, but at least not cited as much as they perhaps should be.

Our goal was to write a comprehensive paper focussing on the notion of intrinsic core of convex sets in general vector spaces. In fact what was assumed was a triviality was a mistake on my part, which was pointed out by a referee and led to some exciting explorations.

First things first. The setting for all this business is a general real vector space, which is enough to define convex sets, and not only that, observe a myriad of counterintuitive phenomena that trivialise in the finite-dimensional setting.

Now consider some convex set in the Euclidean space, for instance, this triangle that lives in the plane and lacks some parts of its boundary:

![A triangle with deficient faces](/assets/images/triangle.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

In the absence of topology we can describe the closure of this triangle using intersections with lines. Any intersection of this triangle with a line is a line segment due to convexity, so we can simply collect all the endpoints of such line segments and add them to the set. That way we recover the boundary of our triangle. In the finite-dimensional setting this linear boundary coincides with the topological boundary. 


this triangle in a line segment (that may be closed, open, half-open, degenerate or empty). In all of these cases we can clearly identify the points that lie in the interior of this line segment as well as the onese lying on its boundary.
